Hi everyone, glad to be here.

The paper I'm about to present draws from my dissertation, which ins't strictly about open science but is heavily inspired by challenges that digital archaeologists commonly face while engaging with open research data.

All archaeological research practices are activities that occur within a social environment and are activities that involve working with data.

Archaeological research is inherently collaborative in that it involves the participation of numerous people implementing various tools and methods, across different locales and time scales, to produce a collective data stream.

This collective data stream is partially manifested by a project database, but also typically includes other media including paper records, files stored on numerous usb thumb drives, trench reports, scrap notes, and stories about the history of work at a project.

These media enable project participants to share their distributed experiences and engagements with archaeological materials with the rest of the team, and enable their collectve efforts to be directed towards productive ends.

My work therefore involves identifying how archaeologists working in different capacities create, use, and value all these forms of information, and how they all contribute to and are shaped by archaeological data management practices and information infrastructures.

So in another sense, my work examines the social and technical aspects of information infrastructures that direct archaeological knowledge towards productive ends.

Here I'll document some aspects of data sharing practices that occur within projects and among close colleagues, and call attention to disjunctures between established norms and expectations on the one hand and new forms of collaborative commitments brought about by participating in systems designed to facilitate particular visions of open science.

But first a little bit about my methods and cases.

I draw from video records of archaeologists as they work, including conversational and retrospective interviews that inquire about their work practices. I also analyzeed documents that archaeologists produce throughout their work. I collected data over three years pertaining to three cases. One case involved longitudinal observation over the course of three years, one was particularly inclined towards the use of digital tools, and one constitutes a data sharing consortium drawing from multiple projects based in a specific region. I applied qualitative data analysis methods to examine this rich and complex dataset, and this paper constitutes only segment of the findings derived from my doctoral dissertation. All names presented here are pseudonyms. I would also be very happy to discuss some of the technical or logistical challenges involved with this work afterwards during the break.

So without further ado, let's dive into what I found.

## Boundaries

One key aspect of my work is identifying how individuals relate to themselves and to their collective endeavour. A significant aspect of this is the delimitation of the archaeological project as a distinct entity. Projects are interesting because they bind work together under a cohesive identity, and delimit the scope of sanctioned and supported research. In other words, a project legitimizes work, and grants knowledge derived from certain kinds of archaeological engagements as authoritative. This aithority is partially derived from the fact that projects are licensed and funded by state apparatuses. Anything that goes on in a project has to be approved by the person who holds the license, i.e. the project director. He or she has authority to invite or exclude participants from working as a member of the project, and to benefit from it, either by extracting publications which serve as currency on the academic job market, or by obtainining legitimate research experience as a student, with similar ends in mind.

Roles within projects are also demarcated in ways that relate to the organization of archaeological information. A specialist will produce a dataset and report based on a particular subset of material, thus staking ownership of it and its value. Assistants are often called to assist with this work, but their subordination and the lack of perceived creative value of pertaining to their contributions does not allow them to extract value from the dataset in the form of authorship.

This is also manifested in various other menial tasks that do not involve creative agency. Things like washing pottery, doing data entry, excavating as an assistant, sorting lithics, etc. These tasks are usually performed by a class of individuals who may graduate towards a supervisory role, a sort of intermediary stage that involves the creation of written records, albeit records that are not valuable in their present state. These supervisors are themselves managed and their work is extracted into a database and overall project report from which creative work can be derived.

Information only reaches peak value when it is shared outside the project, typically in the form of a written publication (a conference presentation typically does not include a stable written component, and is thus relegated to an informal act of sharing, "just a taste"). A certain set of individuals are expected to be able to gain the most value out of a project's research materials, so why would they relinquish this by sharing them before they've extracted the value for themselves? Even archaeologists who do share their data do so after they have sucked the orange dry; they leave the scraps for anyone who may be interested in picking at it, but do not commit to supporting such endeavours if they are not able to get involved in those additional extractive measures.

These boundaries, between project and non-project, between creative and non-creative agency, and between records at various stages of completion, are all very real and meaningful to archaeologists, even if they can not necessarily articulate where the distinction lies.

The extraction of value from archaeological materials is facilitated by information systems that control the flow of information. Interestingly, this is quite lossy, and removes crucial contextual information from the data that is passed along into more valuable information stores. For instance, field journals....
