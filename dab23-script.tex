\section{Title}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Hi everyone, glad to be here.
  \item The paper I'm about to present draws from my dissertation, which ins't strictly about open science but is heavily inspired by challenges that digital archaeologists commonly face while engaging with open research data,
  \item namely the awkwardness of opening a spreadsheet and entering a world of tacit assumptions and experiences that differ from your own, and the actions taken to reconcile these disparities.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item I consider uploading and downloading formally arranged information to and from a digital repository as just one kind of data sharing, which exists among a range of other additional collaborative actions.
  \item Archaeologists share data all the time through alternative means, following social and technological protocols that don't necessarily involve making the records available 24/7 on the web.
  \item My work basically tries to articulate these ways in which archaeologists already share data, which do not necessarily rely on the global information infrastructures that ``open archaeology'' is concerned with developing.
  \item More specifically, I call attention to the collaborative commitments that acts of sharing entail, and the roles of mediating technologies in these interactions.
  \item I think that many of the problems that we face when developing large-scale, web-based, open data infrastructures relate to our inability to grapple with archaeologists' discomfort and apprehension regarding the expansion if their collaborative commitments into new dimensions, for which the discipline has not yet established social and professional norms.
  \item So I'm here to shed some light on some incongruities between how archaeologists tend to share data on a local and collegial scale, and the very different sociotechnical arrangements that are imposed by open data infrastructures, at least under the paradigm we have opted to pursue.
\end{enumerate}

\section{My Approach}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item First a bit about my approach.
  \item I examine archaeological research as a cultural practice, as work that occurs within a social environment.
  \item I'm less interested in what archaeologists are looking at than how they do it, and crucially, how the meanings they ascertain about things are validated through participation within a collective enterprise.
  \item I'm specifically interested in examining how meanings are derived through collective action, how social and technolgical systems mediate and encourage behaviour targeted towards collectively-held goals, and the tensions that emerge through these cooperative systems.
  \item So I set out to observe and interview archaeologists as they work, and articulate the social and technological circumstances that underlie the formation of a communal data stream.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Data Collection and Analysis}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item I recorded over 150 hours of audio and video footage, based over 90 hours of observation, using three cameras that I placed in different parts of archaeological work environments, including on participants' foreheads.
  \item I conducted over 30 interviews with more than 20 participants.
  \item And examined the documents that archaeologists produce and handle on a regular basis.
  \item I did this over several years, and three cases are represented in my work.
  \item Observations and interviews were held in settings where people were excavating, collecting samples, processing and identifying finds, working at their laptops, giving site tours, and holding casual conversations.
  \item However, most of the evidence I cite here today is derived from retrospective interviews, since this is the most direct way in which archaeologists expressed their attitudes on data sharing and collaboration.
  \item For the sake of keeping good time, I will not go into detail on my data collection and analysis methods, but I'm happy to discuss this in greater depth later on or during the break.
  \item All of the names presented here are pseudonyms, by the way.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Archaeological Project Collectives}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item So one of my points of departure was my puzzlement about how archaeological research could actually get done.
  \item Archaeological projects are very messy affairs.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item They comprise teams of people
    \item working in different settings,
    \item in sequence and in tandem,
    \item at different time scales,
    \item using a variety of tools,
    \item applying a diverse range of methods,
    \item bringing their own unique outlooks and experiences,
    \item and responding to local circumstances and challenges.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Archaeological projects are like other miracles of distributed work, such as large open source software development projects and wikipedia, in that they implement social and technological systems to help ensure that work is done in a cooperative and productive manner, and to validate the information they produce.
  \item Members of archaeological projects pool their data into communal data streams, using a combination of digital and analog devices and protocols, such as labelled tags and samole baggies, spreadsheets and todo lists, email attachments, text messages, artefact registries, and loads cheap USB thumb drives scattered all over the dig house.
  \item And they moderate information flows by distributing work across the team.
  \item A project director, who oversees all work, assembles the sociotechnical system by recruiting members from their professional networks and by establishing norms and protocols for sharing and validating information.
  \item However, each individual comes with their own priorities and expectations, and directors try to ensure that all work is fulfilling for individual and the collective alike.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Social Organization Within Projects}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item In the interest of time, I won't elaborate much on how specific tasks are distributed, i.e. the makeup of project hierarchies, which I write about in much greater depth in my dissertation.
  \item Instead, I'll focus on a few significant factors relating to the distribution of agency within collaborative project systems and the implications for fostering more effective data sharing strategies at large.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Territoriality 1}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item In general, I observed that work is distribution in a territorial manner.
  \item Most people within a project are allocated a specific domain corresponding with their role.
  \item In fieldwork, for instance, each supervisor retains control over the trench that they are assigned to excavate.
  \item For example, Lauren, a trench supervisor at Case A, discussed her collegial relationship with Theo, work supervises work on another nearby trench.
  \item They regularly share insights on each other's work, but it's clear that each person retains control over their respective trenches.
  \item Similarly, Ben identifies his trench as an extension of him, as something that reflects his personality and his competency as an archaeologist.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Territoriality 2}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item With regards to specialist work -- including analysis of archaeological finds, samples, and relationships -- Basil, the project director for Case A, feels a need to ensure that work is distributed fairly and with clear intent.
  \item He sees that specialists, especially those early in their careers, are anxious about retaining control over a particular slice of research materials,and he tries to assuage these fears by being very upfront about his expectations regarding what each person is responsible for.
  \item The allocation of research materials, which can be leveraged to produce published research outputs, has tangible effects on people's careers, and Basil therefore takes this very seriously.
  \item At the same time, he rewards seniority and uses the promise of access to research materials as a way of enticing more involved participation in the project.
\end{enumerate}
  
\section{Territoriality 3}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item With regards to projects as a whole, Rufus, who co-directs Case B, identifies project directors as the most invested stakeholders, due to the effort they expend getting things off the ground.
  \item Of course, their territory only pertains to projects that they lead themselves, which reifies the boundaries between projects.
  \item This seems to mirror the structure of corporate firms, whose boundaries are defined by what is owned by the owners, or in these cases, the directors.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Agency and Activity Systems 1}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item I also noticed systematic behaviour regarding the distribution of agency within activity systems.
  \item For instance, trench supervisors wield creative agency in their trenches, and leverage their assistants as tools to support the creation of context recording sheets and trench reports.
  \item Assistants such as Ben, as in the example on screen, may be left in the dark about why they do things in certain ways.
  \item However, when they acquire this understanding they may eventually take on creative agency over their own trenches.
  \item Ben started off as a trench assistant, and in that role he simply did what he was told to do.
  \item He effectively worked as his supervisors' digging instrument.
  \item But when he came back the next season, he became a trench supervisor, and this new role gave him a new imperative to fill out recording sheets.
  \item He lamented that he was encouraged to work his assistants in a similar way as he was worked the previous season.
  \item He recognized that his position is that of a quick and efficient collector of archaeological materials, and a producer of preliminary reports, which he then commits to the finds specialists and project director for further study and synthesis.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Agency and Activity Systems 2}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Project directors draw from these trench reports and assembles overarching articles or monographs pertaining to the project as a whole.
  \item For the director, each supervisor's contribution is genericized in the same was as the assistants are genericized for the supervisors.
  \item Supervisors are rendered as tools that the director mobilizes in order to complete activities in which he is the creative agent.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Agency and Activity Systems 3}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item We may extend this even further by identifying people who integrate data derived from multiple projects as creative agents in their own activity systems, and which leverage the work that project directors produce in a similar way.
  \item To deal with the insecurity that project directors sense when sharing the fruits of their labour, George established a data sharing consortium built atop existing personal and professional collaborations among archaeologists working in a specific region.
  \item In this consortium, everyone already knows everyone, which makes it very difficult to genericize anyone's contributions or co-opt others' work without their direct participation.
  \item This consortium therefore maintains the collaborative commitments that back each project's autonomy.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Summary: Agency and Activity Systems}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item It is notable that in each of these ``levels'', the expectation of authorship, or general recognition of credit, gradually disappears.
  \item Internal trench reports, published project reports, and synthetic studies, each exclude the people they depend upon, unless this effect is actively mitigated, as in the last case I mentioned.
  \item In any given activity, a certain set of individuals hold creative agency, or the power to assemble people and tools in a manner that suits their goals.
  \item It is also noteworthy that only activities where upper management wields creative agency hold the potential to garner some legitimately valuable outcome.
  \item For instance, excavators produce records that are not useful in themselves, and the products of their work must be integrated and analyzed by publishing members of the team in order to yield valued findings.
  \item Once the information collected in the trench leaves that setting and enters the dig house or the database, it enters a different functional realm, no longer a product derived from intimate familiarity with a trench, and becomes a generic resource to be leveraged by a publishing member of the team.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Formal Records and Situated Representations 1}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item This is facilitated through the use of information systems comprising both digital and analog components, which bring together records produced from across the project.
  \item These direct information flow towards specific ends, namely the integration of information collected across various research contexts.
  \item For example, the observations recorded on a context recording sheet during excavation are linked up with analysis of finds or samples retrieved in that context.
\end{enumerate}
  
\section{Formal Records and Situated Representations 2}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Certain kinds of integrations are afforded based on the kinds of records that these systems are able to parse.
  \item In my observations, only information formally arranged on recording sheets or in spreadsheets are transferred to a project's database.
  \item Everything else, including tentative or ephemeral records, planning or strategy documents, and any representation that includes the perspectives of the people who created the record in a prominent role, are either dumped on a hard drive, discarded, or forgotten.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Field Journals 1}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item However, field journals comprise one of a few exceptional media that straddle this division.
  \item Field journals describe the gradual act of discovery, whereby the trench and its constituent excavation units gain significance in relation to the project's overall aims.
  \item Journal entries switch between atomic and descriptive characterizations of specific elements within the trench, and more speculative associations that draw the trench within a broader understanding of the site as a whole.
  \item In this way, field journals are explicitly discursive media in that they describe and discuss particular aspects of a project from situated perspectives, and contextualize and define an object's significance based on particular experiences with it.
  \item Or, as one of my informants put it, journals are like a "stream of conciousness", which are meant to convey the thoughts that inform and influence more formally-defined data.
\end{enumerate}
  
\section{Field Journals 2}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item In the cases I observed, field journals were never transcribed or codified into formal representations, or generally applied towards analytical tasks.
  \item They are used as memnotic devices, to recall and reconstruct the mindset of the person who worked with the recorded material at specific moments in time.
  \item This was exemplified by Liz's experiences collecting and integrating data from projects that she has not participated in, for her doctoral research.
  \item She specifically recalls that ``the very first thing I do is read the notebooks, because that’s where you get sort of what their, \dots their sort of thought process throughout the whole thing, which makes it so much easier to then dive into the actual meticulous data''.
  \item Reading field journals draws Liz into the project, enabling her to share in the experiences of archaeological discovery, thus establishing a kind of parasocial relationship that affords her with a similar degree of understanding as an actual team participant might have had.
  \item Obtaining access to field journal, thus, understandably, requires that trust be established.
  \item Liz had to reach out to project directors to request access.
  \item She had to make her case with a value proposition, and enter into a collaborative commitment in which she was placed in a dependent position.

  \item In general, field journals contain very rich information about physical and social circumstances regarding the creation of a dataset.
  \item Despite the fact that the information they contain is critical for making sense of formal records in contexts of reuse, it is extremely difficult to translate these records in ways that can be leveraged in formal representations.
  \item Moreover, this information is communicated in trust, and is only accessible people who enter into a collaborative or pseudo-collaborative association.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Tensions with open data infrastructures}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item So what makes field journals particularly interesting is their capacity to bring back the voice of the excavator, which is lost as records are synthesized up the food chain.
  \item Somehow, they cut across all of that.
  \item They are distinct in that, as I recalled earlier, they are explicitly discursive records, whereas records stored in a database or published in a digital repository are presented as stable representations of reality.
  \item Their instability, informality, and exclusivity are valuable features, especially in light of conclusions arrived at in other studies of data reuse, which highlight the fact that reusers seek out more contextual information and enter into a discursive relationship with those who produced the dataset they are trying to access.
  \item And on the other side of the archive, people who share data tend to express apprehension about relinquishing control over the data that they expended so much labour to produce.
  \item They feel uncomfortable by the prospect of having the data, which they spent so much time and effort to produce, being misrepresented or misused in ways that they did not anticipate.
  \item One strategy they employ is by just doing as much analysis as possible in-house, and publishing a husk of a dataset, with all its value extracted.
  \item In general then, archaeologists try to seek out or maintain collaborative commitment that they feel open data infrastructures do not currently support.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Where do we go from here?}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item I find it really ironic that the formal and transactional protocols meant to streamline mutual comprehension of a dataset reveal their own inadequacy for achieving their stated purpose, and the strengths of the system that they are meant to replace.
  \item the frictionless aspect of infrastructures is therefore not always adequate
  \item we need to build in the social relations that will support deeper collaboration
  \item but even more than that, and surely more difficult to achieve, is fostering a novel sense of collaborative commitment, particularly on the part of data producers.
  \item What kind of long-term commitment is appropriate to ask of them, if it is at all?
  \item I'm not quite sure whether handing out sucked oranges, or pre-assembled lego sets with pieces either missing or glued together, is enough to qualify as being "open".
  \item But if we are going to prioritize a shift to a discursive paradigm, which I believe is called for based on what has been expressed in numerous studies on data sharing and reuse, including my own research, we need to draw up reasonable ways of ensuring that all parties are gonna pick up the phone when it rings for them.
  \item In other words, we need to foster new kinds of collaborative commitments that extend beyond the scope of a project's boundaries.
\end{enumerate}
