Open data platforms have emerged as important elements of global information infrastructures, which are designed to enable digital archaeological research to flourish, especially research that involves integrating and reusing published datasets. While these systems are technically impressive, numerous studies have demonstrated that they fail to broker a meaningful sense of trust between data producers and reusers. For instance, @faniel2013 reported that data reusers seek information about datasets' originators to gauge their potential value; @opitz2021 highlighted scholars' apprehensions when relinquishing control over how their data will be used in alternative research contexts; and @huggett2022 raised significant concerns regarding the epistemic distance between contexts of data creation and data reuse that is afforded by these technological platforms. These problems demonstrate a collectively-held sense that there is more to a dataset than what is captured in records and documentation shared on open data platforms. Interestingly, archaeologists respond to these challenges by seeking ways to relate on a subtextual level, in what might most effectively entail a traditional collaborative relationship. It is quite ironic, then, that the formal and transactional protocols meant to streamline mutual comprehension of a dataset reveal their own inadequacy for achieving their stated purpose and the strengths of the system that they are meant to replace.

This paper examines this issue by highlighting factors that contribute to data sharing in relatively bounded collaborative systems, namely within two individual archaeological projects and within a regional data sharing consortium with limited scope and targeted ressearch objectives. More specifically, I examine how collaborating project participants establish mutual comprehension, by comparing the creation and management of formal records with various means of communicating situated experiences, including the use of field journals, site tours, published reports, newsletters, and other vectors of personal communication.

My findings hightlight that situated experiences, though crucial for obtaining a critical understanding of formal records' potental and limitations, form their own less mobile sets of representative media, which are less less amenable to widespread distribution at scale due to social and technological factors. I also identify aspects of sociotechnical structures, such as participation within archaeological project collectives (which are venues for the reproduction of collaborative commitments, community norms, and professional and ethical expectations), that should be considered as we continue to devise data governance strategies.
