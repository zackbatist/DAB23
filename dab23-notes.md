My findings highlight the different values ascribed to formal records and eliciations of situated experiences; in particular, it is noteworthy that the latter make up an largely separate, stagnant, and lasting data stream, as the former move on to be processed, transformed and shared across multiple research contexts. The technological affordances and limitations, as well as the social and pragmatic values and priorities therefore split archaeological modes of understanding into a transmissable, applicable, yet lossy data package, and a more closely-held awareness of records' constructed nature that is not only difficult to document and share but also threatens to undermine the value held by the former and more formal means of representation.

This amounts to what @huggett2022, @lucas2019 and @wylie2017 characterized as a sense of "epistemic anxiety", whereby archaeologists come up against a discrepancy between their understanding of data's limitations and the restricted sets of possibilities afforded by the social and technological infrastructures we inhabit. I argue that the solutions lie in recognizing and challenging the taken for granted collaborative commitments that structure how we work, and which are reinforced by technological solutions.


So we find ourselves at a crossroads, where we must decide can continue to engineer unsatisfactory technological solutions to problems that 



My findings indicate that less formal means of communication are crucial for fostering collaborative ties that support effective data sharing and reuse in the smaller scale cases I examined. However these are difficult, if not impossible, to translate to global infrastructures, which embody distinct sets of collaborative commitments that prioritize formal records management, to the point that all else constitutes a separate and more exclusive data stream, accessible only to those who share collaborative relationships.

I propose that greater emphasis be placed on community building over technological solutionism. More specifically, I propose that we reconsider the fundamental collaborative commitments involved in data sharing as it occurs in various contexts (e.g. within projects, among close collaborators, and openly via the web), which manifested in the means by which we ascribe value to various modes of understanding and communication.



(the latter of which tends to reinforce existing power structures)

However, these factors tend to constitute a separate and non-public repository of knowledge that

under our present expectations regarding what data sharing is and ought to be like, can not be shared in a way that maintains their functional value.

This paper therefore contributes to an alternative view of data sharing that emphasizes community building over technological solutionism. In particular, I suggest that we pay more attention to how

This involves recognizing that communities have boundaries, that trust and inclusion are not guaranteed but earned, and that knowledge production is social and pragmatic, and necessitates consideration of sustainable data governance strategies.

I frame data sharing, whether it occurs between close colleagues or as mediated by open data platforms among strangers, as comprising a series of collaborative commitments. Many of these commitments are being stretched and transformed through enactment of open archaeology.


## Comments on the abstract from Camille
Looks good! How long is it supposed to be? I ask because I wonder if you can make the first paragraph more concise (to further highlight your paper). I might also suggest adding a bit more context or details re: your findings? Like can you say it's part of your dissertation research? I feel that without those details it's kind of like, who is this guy and why is he doing this? But Im not sure! I also think it's good as-is

- make the first paragraph more concise
- add more context or details re: your findings
- say it's part of your dissertation research
- without those details it's kind of like, who is this guy and why is he doing this?


## Maybe useful for CAA paper

I also consider how projects' organizational structures and information systems direct the flow of archaeological labour and data derived thereof towards productive ends; data governance models, which include implicit professional expectations regarding who may access and benefit from the collectively-maintained pool of information generated through years of distributed labour, are significant factors that effect how collaboration occurs within and beyond a project's scope.

## quick notes for potential edits, Jan 28
replace section 5 on archaeological projects with something like "recognizing discursive warrants for research"

make it more about defining that projects are assemblages of people, who come together based on converging interests, which ties into the next section on territoriality

hint at the inseparability between data management and people management, with something like we need people to make this work, tools wont hold themselves, questions wont pose or answer themselves

people work at archaeological projects for various reasons, but generally they are brought on based on the professional collaborative network of the project director

nail down the main point immediately before or after agency and activity systems 3, which draws their attention towards the implications for open science

namely, highlight the fact that creative agency gradually dissolves as the network is extended in scope, which also involves the re-allocation of credit and ownership over data

the solution that case 3 came up with is to halt dissemination beyond their little group, thus maintaining a greater degree of recognition and trust than would otherwise be the case if sharing with complete strangers

we see this within projects too, as work is recognized within each scale, but not beyond that

everyone need that recognition to motivate their efforts and to feel as if they themselves are contributing something, and not simply being used as throw away tools (see thorpe)

in other words, each scale is productive only because they establish a collaborative feeling, which involves establishing a close boundary around the community, which in turn corresponds with a set of goals or directives that bind all participants together

there is no such question or goal driven collaboration when sharing data on the web with strangers

the data are framed as a final publication, with no room for addition or improvement

also corresponds with reusers need to understand context, in the form of what this data was for, who made it, how it was made, etc, essentially gaining more familiarity with the on the ground reality of how data were produced or integrated, which is usually info that is privy only to collaborators
