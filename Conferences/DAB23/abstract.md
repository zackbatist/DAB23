Open data platforms have emerged as important elements of global information infrastructures, which are designed to enable digital archaeological research to flourish, especially research that involves integrating and reusing published datasets [@kintigh2015]. While these systems are technically impressive, numerous studies have demonstrated their failure to make data sharing and reuse easier to accomplish; [@faniel2013: 299; @atici2013; @kansa2013 and @sobotkova2018] highlighted how data reusers seek out greater contextual information regarding how the data were produced, and [@opitz2021 and @strupler2017: 294-295] addressed a sense of apprehension felt by data producers regarding how their data will be applied in secondary research contexts. These tendencies indicate that archaeologists who both produce and reuse data recognize that there is usually more to the story than what is captured in records and documentation shared on these platforms, and actively seek ways to relate on a subtextual level, in what might most effectively entail a traditional collaborative relationship. It is quite ironic, then, that the formal and transactional protocols meant to streamline mutual comprehension of a dataset reveal their own inadequacy for achieving their stated purpose and the strengths of the system that they are meant to replace.

This paper examines this issue by highlighting factors that contribute to data sharing in relatively bounded collaborative systems, namely within individual archaeological projects and within a research consortium with limited scope and targeted ressearch objectives. More specifically, I examine means of facilitating mutual comprehension by comparing the creation and management of formal records with various ways of communicating situated experiences, including the use of field journals, site tours, published reports, and various vectors of personal communication.

My findings indicate that less formal means of communication, whose degree of inclusiveness is limited by social and pragmatic factors, are crucial for fostering collaborative ties that support effective data sharing and reuse. However, these factors tend to constitute a separate and non-public repository of knowledge that, I argue, can not be shared in a way that maintains their functional value.

My work thus encourages acceptance of an alternative view of data sharing that prioritizes community building over technological buildup. This involves recognizing that communities have boundaries, that trust and inclusion are not guaranteed but earned, and that knowledge sharing is a social practice that necessitates consideration of sustainable data governance strategies.

I frame data sharing, whether it occurs between close colleagues or as mediated by open data platforms among strangers, as comprising a series of collaborative commitments. Many of these commitments are being stretched and transformed through enactment of open archaeology.
