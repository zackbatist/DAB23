- Reference to the red shit indicates a casual assumption that everyone knows how common it is throughout the site, and while this may be referred to in a report as a common occurrence, the more situational relations that the red shit has with other contexts, i e the fact that it occurs in some trenches more intensively than in others, in ways that effect the ways each French was dug and material was extracted and sampled, are not as prevalent. Iâ€™m a conversation this can be explained, in a report this can be described and accounted for.

Open data platforms have emerged as important elements of global information infrastructures, which are designed to enable digital archaeological research to flourish, particularly research that involves integrating and reusing published datasets [@kintigh2015]. While these systems are technically impressive, their failure to deal with significant social and epistemic challenges, particularly the challenge of brokering trust in the information they host, pose problems that seriously undermine their value. More specifically, archaeologists who both produce and reuse data recognize that there is usually more to the story than what is captured in records and documentation shared on these platforms, and actively seek ways to relate on a subtextual level, in what might most effectively entail a traditional collaborative relationship [@faniel2013: 299; @atici2013; @kansa2013; @opitz2021; @strupler2017: 294-295; Huggett 2018: 98-99; _inter alia_]. It is quite ironic that the formal and transactional protocols meant to streamline mutual comprehension of a dataset reveal their own inadequacy for achieving their stated purpose and the strengths of the system that they are meant to replace.

This paper examines this issue by comparing the different ways in which formal records and situated accounts are treated and valued by various stakeholders. I draw from a qualitative study of collaborative research practices among archaeologists, based on recorded observations, interviews, and document analysis from three cases, including work in two separate fieldwork environments and pertaining to one regional data sharing consortium.

My findings highlight specific perspectives on the value of field journals, recording sheets, spreadsheets, trench reports, published articles, and site tours in transmitting valuable information. It highlights feelings of apprehension and anticipation as the reality of data sharing and reuse fail to live up to the purported and imagined benefits (if you build it, they will come, engineering mentality equating can do / will do)

Archaeological projects are collaborative spaces where people holding various roles and implementing a wide array of tools and methods collect, process, organize, maintain and analyze a communal data stream centred on a topic and material assemblage of mutual concern. Projects rely on organizational structures and information systems to help coordinate labour and to direct research towards productive ends, in what amounts to a series of _collaborative commitments_, or normative professional expectations regarding who does what work, how work is carried out, and what the expected research outputs should look like. Enacting open archaeology, with its relatively novel social and technological arrangements, involves grappling with these established collaborative commitments.

This paper presents a qualitative study of collaborative research practices among archaeologists, based on recorded observations, interviews, and document analysis from three cases, including work in two separate fieldwork environments and pertaining to one regional data sharing consortium. I applied an abductive qualitative data analysis approach to identify the collaborative commitments involved in these settings, and which hold clear implications for data sharing within and among archaeological projects.

My findings indicate that social challenges, and not merely technological issues, must be addressed to encourage data sharing at scale. Specifically, I examine how various stakeholders identify with their roles and with the information they interact with. The contextual

Translating established collaborative research practices towards global data sharing initiatives

Archaeological knowledge is inherently produced through collaborative efforts, whereby people working as parts of project teams apply various tools and methods in multiple settings to examine materials of communal interest. This is facilitated by implementing organizational structures and information systems that help coordinate this distributed labour and direct research towards targeted ends. For example, distinctions between specialist domains, separations between data collection and analysis, and enforcement of data collection and integration protocols, all comprise social and technical means of controlling information flows and establishing data's epistemic character as objective and legitimate archaeological records. In other words, archaeological projects establish _collaborative commitments_, backed by professional norms and expectations and by information infrastructures, that give data their value and enable them to be applied for various analytical functions.

Interestingly, the established norms that govern archaeological collaboration on the relatively small scale of the individual project closely resemble the tenets and desired outcomes sought after by various open data initiatives, which have generally not succeeded in their goals of facilating effective data reuse. This paper examines these failures to normalize data sharing at scale in light of existing data sharing behaviours that occur within individual archaeological projects. More specifically, I frame data sharing, whether it occurs between close colleagues or as mediated by open data platforms among strangers, as comprising a series of collaborative commitments. My work thus centres on addressing how the social structures and information systems commonly employed by archaeologists foster certain kinds of collaborative commitments, and considers how we might translate these factors to function at a global scale.

This paper draws from a qualitative study of collaborative research practices among archaeologists based on recorded observations, interviews, and document analysis from 3 cases, including one longitudinal case spanning 3 years and one case that comprises a regional data sharing consortium. I applied an inductive qualitative data analysis approach, which involves reviewing the data to draw out sensitive concepts, coding the interview transcripts and observations to identify entities, activities, attitudes, and elements of my developing theories for comparative analysis, and intensive memoing to draw these theories out and to form the basis for more synthetic findings.

My findings indicate that social challenges, and not merely technological issues, must be addressed to encourage data sharing at scale. Special attention is paid to how stakeholders are established in relation to particular datasets, and their perceptions regarding their contributions to data's value. Moreover, the kinds of relationships that bind these stakeholders together and enable them to contribute towards common goals are examined in terms of how effective they are at facilitating meaningful communication and at fostering trust, which I establish as key factors influencing whether data may be effectively reused.
