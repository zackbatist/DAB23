My findings highlight the different values ascribed to formal records and eliciations of situated experiences; in particular, it is noteworthy that the latter make up an largely separate, stagnant, and lasting data stream, as the former move on to be processed, transformed and shared across multiple research contexts. The technological affordances and limitations, as well as the social and pragmatic values and priorities therefore split archaeological modes of understanding into a transmissable, applicable, yet lossy data package, and a more closely-held awareness of records' constructed nature that is not only difficult to document and share but also threatens to undermine the value held by the former and more formal means of representation.

This amounts to what @huggett2022, @lucas2019 and @wylie2017 characterized as a sense of "epistemic anxiety", whereby archaeologists come up against a discrepancy between their understanding of data's limitations and the restricted sets of possibilities afforded by the social and technological infrastructures we inhabit. I argue that the solutions lie in recognizing and challenging the taken for granted collaborative commitments that structure how we work, and which are reinforced by technological solutions.


So we find ourselves at a crossroads, where we must decide can continue to engineer unsatisfactory technological solutions to problems that 



My findings indicate that less formal means of communication are crucial for fostering collaborative ties that support effective data sharing and reuse in the smaller scale cases I examined. However these are difficult, if not impossible, to translate to global infrastructures, which embody distinct sets of collaborative commitments that prioritize formal records management, to the point that all else constitutes a separate and more exclusive data stream, accessible only to those who share collaborative relationships.

I propose that greater emphasis be placed on community building over technological solutionism. More specifically, I propose that we reconsider the fundamental collaborative commitments involved in data sharing as it occurs in various contexts (e.g. within projects, among close collaborators, and openly via the web), which manifested in the means by which we ascribe value to various modes of understanding and communication.



(the latter of which tends to reinforce existing power structures)

However, these factors tend to constitute a separate and non-public repository of knowledge that

under our present expectations regarding what data sharing is and ought to be like, can not be shared in a way that maintains their functional value.

This paper therefore contributes to an alternative view of data sharing that emphasizes community building over technological solutionism. In particular, I suggest that we pay more attention to how

This involves recognizing that communities have boundaries, that trust and inclusion are not guaranteed but earned, and that knowledge production is social and pragmatic, and necessitates consideration of sustainable data governance strategies.

I frame data sharing, whether it occurs between close colleagues or as mediated by open data platforms among strangers, as comprising a series of collaborative commitments. Many of these commitments are being stretched and transformed through enactment of open archaeology.


## Comments on the abstract from Camille
Looks good! How long is it supposed to be? I ask because I wonder if you can make the first paragraph more concise (to further highlight your paper). I might also suggest adding a bit more context or details re: your findings? Like can you say it's part of your dissertation research? I feel that without those details it's kind of like, who is this guy and why is he doing this? But Im not sure! I also think it's good as-is

- make the first paragraph more concise
- add more context or details re: your findings
- say it's part of your dissertation research
- without those details it's kind of like, who is this guy and why is he doing this?
